#Datacatalog
Data catalog helps you find the data you need, not just the data you already know. Use Catalog to enrich your analyses by filtering and searching through all of your organization’s data. And Catalog is easy to update: now everyone interested can take advantage of data resources as they become available.

Users work together to register sources, search, filter, tag, comment on, and otherwise describe their data. With Catalog, everyone can see information about where data is and who is associated with it. Your organization will share a centralized repository of metadata and the knowledge that clusters around it.

To make decisions about your data, you have to understand what you already have – and where you have it. Zoom in and filter on sources of interest. Quickly answer questions about redundancy and integrity.
